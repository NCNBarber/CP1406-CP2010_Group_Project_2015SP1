For making new files, use the templatepage.php file as a starting point to see how the CSS will affect the code that you're writing and use the existing divs to test how the content will appear on the finished website. Don't modify any existing CSS, but add new div classes or ids as you see fit. If any of the existing CSS needs changing we can do it when we meet up next.
Good luck everyone!
